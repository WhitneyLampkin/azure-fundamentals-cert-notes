	- IT department wants to upgrade firmware on thermostats if needed
		- Concerned about it costing a lot of money
		- Solution: Azure IoT Hub
	- Need to keep the thermostats secure
		- Concerned with connecting them to the internet
		- Solution: Azure Sphere (but requires devices with MCUs)
	- Use ML for research
		- Large amount of data in a Data Lake Storage
		- Need to analyze data and build ML models 
			- Solution: Azure Synapse Analytics
		- Scalable solution for millions of rows of data
			- Solution: Azure HDInsights
		- Unstructured data
			- Solution: Azure Databricks
