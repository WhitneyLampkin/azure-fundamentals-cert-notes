Skill 3.2: Describe Azure management tools

- Azure Portal
	- Today's portal is the 3rd major iteration of Azure Portal
		- Came when Microsoft moved to ARM
	- Azure Portal calls ARM on the backend
	- Home - default view in Azure Portal
		- Shows icons for various services
			- Clicking the icon shows resources for the service type that you've created
		- Settings button  shows left sidebar menu with same icons and more called the Azure Portal Menu
			- Menu can be re-ordered
			- App Service Plan - shows all App Service Plans
				- Can click a resource in the plan
		- Shows recently accessed resources
		- Azure Cloud Shell button to the right of the search bar
		- Filter button to the right of the Azure Cloud Shell button - used to show resources in a certain Azure subscription or AAD
		- Notifications Button - Azure related notifications
		- Settings button 
			- Change default view
			- Choose docked or flying menu
			- Change theme
			- Disable toast notifications
			- Restore default settings
			- Export settings
			- Delete all settings and dashboards
		- Click profile icon
			- Log out
			- Change AAD
	- Opening Resources from App Service Plans page
		- Shows left menu specific to that resource
		- Main window shows different items based on resource
			- Referred to as blades in Azure Portal
	- Blades
		- Overview Blade - Common to most Azure resources
		- Diagnose and Solve Problems Blade 
		- Blades may be different per resources because each resource has its own team and they design based on what they feel their features needs
	- Customizing the Dashboard
		- Click Dashboard in Azure Portal Menu
		- Click pencil edit icon
		- Make Changes
			- Rename dashboard
			- Add tiles to the dashboard by choosing from the gallery
			- Delete existing tiles
		- Click 'Done' to finalize
	- Create new dashboards for specific purposes
		- i.e. Web Apps Only Dashboard
- Azure PowerShell
	- Azure PowerShell AZ Module - offers cross-platform support for Windows, Linux or macOS
		- Uses .NET Standard Library for functionality
		- Runs PowerShell v5,6,7
			- v6 & 7 are cross-platform and run on Linux, Mac or Windows
		- When running Windows 7 or later with PowerShell v5, install .NET Framework 4.7.2
		- Has to be installed before use
			- Run PowerShell elevated
				- Windows - run as admin
				- Linux, MacOS - run with superuser privileges using Sudo
				- Installation Command: 'Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber'
					- If PowerShell finds the command name already exists, the installation fails
					- 'AllowClobber' - tells PowerShell it's ok to precedence for any commands that exist in another module
				- If running in admin mode (elevated) is not an option install for your ID only with
					- Personal Installation Command - 'Install-Module -Name Az -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser'
			- After installation, sign in with Azure account with 'Connect-AzAccount'
				- Azure Sign-in Command: 'Connect-AzAccount'
					- Rerun command after closing to authenticate another session
				- This command shows token in the PowerShell Window
				- Enter token at Authenticate PowerShell Session to authenticate the PowerShell Session
			- Set Active Subscription Command: 'Set-AzContext -Subscription "subscription_id"'
	- Azure PowerShell Az module commands
		- Start with verb and an object
			- Verb - New, Get, Move or Remove
			- Object - What you want the verb to affect
				- E.g. New-AzResourceGroup -Name MyRG - Location "South Central US"
				- E.g. Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name MyRG
					- Type 'y' to confirm deletion
	- PowerShell Command Scripts - perform a number of operations at once
		- Cannot type 'y' to confirm so use -Force parameter to bypass the prompt
			- E.g. Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name MyRG -Force
	- PowerShell commands used to use AzureRm module
		- Commands are the same but the module has a new name
- Azure CLI
	- Scripting for those who don't know PowerShell
	- aka Azure Command-Line interface
	- Can be scripted using shell scripts in various languages like Python, Ruby, etc.
	- Cross-platform: Windows, Linux, MacOS with v2 or later
	- Installation Steps
	- After installation
		- Login to AZ command: 'az login'
			- Opens browser automatically
		- Set default subscription command: 'az account set --subscription "subscription_id"'
		- Get list of commands command: 'az resource create --help'
		- Use --force parameter to disable prompts
			- Must be included with CLI and PowerShell scripting  or it won't work
		- Interactive Mode - easy way to learn CLI: 'az interactive'
			- Autocomplete
			- Scoping of commands
			- And more
			- CLI will install the feature
			- Press right arrow key to enter the suggested command when typing
		- All CLI Extensions command: 'az extension list-available --output table'
			- Shows all available extensions and what you have installed
		- Installing Extensions command: 'az extension add --name extension_name'
	- Note - PS uses 1 dash (-) and CLI uses 2 (--)
- Azure Cloud Shell
	- Web-based command shell to interact with Azure from the command line in the cloud
	- Create resources and more
	- Used by the 'Try It' button in Portal
	- Cloud Shell button is directly to the right of the search bar
		- Choose environment the first time: Bash or PowerShell
		- Create Azure Storage Account 
			- Because Cloud Shell persists everything installed and user settings
		- Cloud Shell menu bar
			- Environment DDL selector
			- Power Button - restart session
			- Help
			- Settings
			- Upload/Download Files
			- Open new session of Cloud Shell in new browser tab
			- Open Editor Button - opens an instance of the Monaco Editor for editing scripts and other files (even code files) in the browser
				- To exit, right-click and click 'Quit'
			- Web Preview Button - run web applications using the files in the current folder
				- Can use when developing apps with Cloud Shell
				- Why would someone want to preview an app in Cloud Shell instead of just debugging it locally? Many developers write applications that interact with other Azure services, and they might want to debug these applications while theyâ€™re running in Azure. For command line developers, this technique in Cloud Shell is a powerful way to enable that.
- Azure Mobile App
	- Download to Android or iOS devices to manage Azure resources on the go
		- Also available on mobile web
