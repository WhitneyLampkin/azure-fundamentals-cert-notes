	- 3 Primary Areas of Coverage
		- Policy & Compliance
			- Secure Score and Overall Score show the security of your resources
			- Covers compliance with regulatory standards
			- Information provided by the service being protected
		- Resources Security Hygiene
			- High-level overview of health of your resources from a security perspective
			- Security Issue Categories
				- High Severity
				- Medium Severity
				- Low Severity
			- Information provided by the service being protected
		- Threat Protection
			- Shows active or past attacks or threats on resources
			- Information analyzed is from network traffic and the behavior of users of your resources
		- Suspicious activity is reported to the Security Center
	- Microsoft Threat Intelligence - identify security threats
		- Uses Microsoft historical data and ML to identify possible threats
		- Threats
			- Hacker attempting to gain access
			- User suspicious activity
	- Quick Fix Badge - provides action to allow to fix immediately
	- Just-in-Time (JIT) Access - protects VMs from attacks on management ports
		- Access with 'Just in time VM access' link under 'ADAVANCED CLOUD DEFENSE' section of left menu
		- Click 'Recommend' tab to see VMs without JIT enabled
		- Select a VM to enable
		- Choose which ports to protect
		- Choose which protocols and IPs are allowed over the port
			- 'Per Request' option - user requesting access will have to specify IP address or CIDR block
			- Or you can specify CIDR block yourself to allow access from a specific IP address range
		- Specify max hours a user has access for
			- 1 - 24 hrs
			- Default = 3 hrs
		- Users will then request access from Security Center
			- Click 'Just-in-Time VM Access'
			- Select the VM
			- Click 'Request Access'
			- Specify ports to open
				- Allowed IP Addresses if they weren't setup initially
				- How long access is needed (up to maximum time configured - 24 hours)
- Key Vault (Encryption)
	- Encrypts secrets, keys and certificates for secure storage
	- Common security risk
		- E.g. Storing db usernames and passwords in connection strings in plain text files
	- Stored items
		- Apply security policies that define users and apps that have access to the item
		- Microsoft cannot see the encryption keys or encrypted data
	- Creating Key Vaults in Azure Portal
	- Pricing Tiers
		- Standard Tier
		- Premium Tier - keys stored in hardware security modules (HSMs)
			- HSM - separate piece of hardware designed for securely storing encrypted content and specialized for processing cryptographic data
	- Common Key Vault Uses
		- Generating security keys
		- Store encryption keys for Azure VMs
	- Exam Tip - Keeping encryption keys in an HSM boundary is required for Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2, so companies that need to maintain compliance with FIPS 140-2 can do so by using the Premium tier of Key Vault.
	- Key Vault can generate or users can import keys, secret or certificate into Key Vault
	- Example Keys that can be created
		- 4,096-bit security key
		- 4,096-bit RSA key
	- Generating Keys
		- Click 'Keys' under 'Settings' in left menu
		- Click 'Generate/Import'
		-  Fill out 'Create a key' form
	- Reviewing Keys
		- Get the key identifier - URL can be used by authorized users or applications to retrieve the key
		- Cannot review the key because it's encrypted and not available except through key identifier
	- Exam Tip - A key stored in Azure Key Vault would typically be accessed programmatically by an application. To protect the key, application developers can retrieve the key each time itâ€™s needed instead of retrieving it once and storing it in memory. This ensures that the key remains secure.
	- Encryption Keys for VMs
		- Security Center recommends encrypting VM disks
		- VM disks stored as VHD files - when VHD files are encrypted, host OS that runs the VM must gain access to the security key in order to decrypt the VHD and run the VM
	- Using Key Vault for Disk Encryption Keys
		- Access policies must be configured to allow the vault for disk encryption
			- Can be configured before or after creation
	- Azure Disk Encryption
		- Enabled on VMs with Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI or ARM template
		- Keys and VMs must be in the same subscription and same Azure region
- Azure Sentinel
	- Watches resources for threats and responds to them
	- Common Security Frameworks
		- SOAR - Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)
		- SIEM - Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
	- Azure Sentinel makes implementing SOAR and SIEM easy
	- Exam Tips
		- Not only for Azure
		- Can report threats and analysis for on-premises resources and resources in other clouds
	- Azure Sentinel sits on top of Log Analytics and watches information it collects
	- Using Azure Sentinel
		- Create a Sentinel Workspace
		- Click 'Connect Workspace' button to create an instance of Azure Log Analytics and add it to the workspace or add existing Azure Log Analytics instance
		- Login and connect data sources to Sentinel using connectors using the 'Connect' button
			- Microsoft, Azure and 3rd-party connectors
			- When added, prerequisites are shown for the connector
		- Click 'Next' to finish complete adding the connector
		- Save connector configuration in Azure Monitor Workbook
	- Azure Monitor Workbook - easily aggregate data so it's easier to consume
	- Sentinel also searches for specific security threats
		- Hunting - allows you to use a query to run against resources
	- Responding to Threats
		- Sentinel can respond using a Playbook
			- Playbook - workflow that runs in response to an alert in Sentinel
		- Creating  a Playbook
			- Click 'Playbooks' in the left menu
			- Click 'Add Playbook' at the top
			- Create a new Logic App
				- Used for the workflows
			- Click 'Blank Logic App'
			- Enter sentinel in search box
			- Click 'When a response to an Azure Sentinel Alert is Triggered'
			- Build workflow
			- Add actions to perform when the alert is triggered
