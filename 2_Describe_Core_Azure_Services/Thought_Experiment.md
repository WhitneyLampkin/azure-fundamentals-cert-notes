# Thought Experiment

- Setup large # of VMs
  - Needs
    - High availability
      - Solution - deploy to multiple regions
    - Protection from disasters in datacenter inside of a region
      - Solution - Availability Zones
    - Protection from power outages
      - Solution - Availability Zones or Sets(?)
    - Deploy 3 Services - need logical groupings
      - 2 for marketing
      - 1 for development division
      - Solution - Resource Groups
    - CTO wants to control access to services and how they are configured
        - - Solution - Management Groups
    - Have specific configurations for virtual networks (VNets)
      - Solution - Azure Virtual Networks
    - Easily deploy to new regions later with same configurations
      - Solution - ARM templates
    - Prevent downtime from reboots and hardware failures
      - Solution - Availability Sets
    - Need to add additional CPU power when traffic spikes but downgrade when it's low again
      - Solution - Scale Sets
    - Move PHP web portal to cloud
      - With easy scaling when usage spikes
      - Solution - Azure App Service
    - Run Docker image in Azure - only runs for a few minutes a month
      - looking for most cost-efficient option
      - Solution - Azure Container Instances (ACI)
    - Also have a containerized image with sporadic usage
      - More complex
      - Requires more computing resources
      - Always needs to be running and available
      - Solution - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKs)
    - Sales employees need to be able to access Office apps from anywhere but not have the data stored on their devices
      - Solution - Windows Virtual Desktop
    - Have multi-tiered apps to move to the cloud but devs don't know how to accomplish that
      - (?)
    - Will still need some things to stay on-premises
      - Large files
      - Animations
      - Don't want to slow down app with large data stored in cloud
      - Privacy
      - Needs a lot of bandwidth
      - Don't want to transfer over internet
      - Solution - ExpressRoute
    - Keep order history stored as PDFs
      - Won't be accessed often but needs to be available in the future if  needed
      - Solution - Azure Blob Storage
    - Persist data on VMs even if downtime happens
      - Solution - Disk Storage (managed)
    - Other persisted data needs to be accessed on-premises running Windows Server 2016 without installing anything
      - Solution - Azure Files
    - Need encrypted MySQL db
      - Azure DB for MySQL
