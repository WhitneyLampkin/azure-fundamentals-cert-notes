	- US government requires that data stays within the USA and that only citizens of US can have access to systems used to store that data
		- This requirement cannot be met with policies
		- Cannot be met at all in a public cloud
		- Azure Government Cloud - Microsoft has isolated Azure data centers
	- Azure Government data centers
		- Separate from public data centers
		- All employees are screened US citizens
		- Microsoft employees providing technical support but must US citizens as well
		- For Federal, city and municipalities as well
		- Users must be vetted
		- Microsoft ExpressRoute locations with dedicated fiber-optic components separate from the other Azure networks specifically for government use
		- Azure Government Cloud vs. Public Cloud
			- Both 
				- Same features and services
				- The skillset is the same so developers using the public cloud can then transition to work using government clouds and use those skills
			- Azure Government 
				- Portal site https://portal.azure.us/
				- URLs for Azure services use .us top-level domain
					- i.e. App Service web app in Azure Government would have the following default domain name: https://webapp.azurewebsites.us/
			- Public 
				- Portal site https://portal.azure.com/
		- United States Department of Defense 
			- DoD Impact Level 5 Provisional Authorization - additional compliance requirements
				- Controlled unclassified information 
				- Requires additional levels of protection
				- Additional DoD requirements are met by a subset of data centers within Azure Government that are approved for DoD usage
	- Azure Germany
		- Develop because of EU's need for unique approach
		- Distinct cloud system to meet compliance needs
		- For customers in EU, The European Free Trade Association and the UK
		- Physically located in Germany

	- Azure China aka Microsoft Azure operated by 21 Vianet aka Azure 21 Vianet
		- Microsoft Azure China - separate cloud for China 
		- Operated in Shanghai Blue Cloud Technology Co., Ltd (aka BlueCloud)
		- BlueCloud
			- Owned by Beijing 21 Vianet Broadband Data Center Co., Ltd (aka 21 Vianet) - an internet data center service provider in China
		- Doesn't offer all of Azure's features but features and services are constantly being added
